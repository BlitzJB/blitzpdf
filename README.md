# BlitzPDF: PDF Generation API with Plain React and TailwindCSS

> `react-pdf` exists. Why should i use `BlitzPDF`?
> While `react-pdf` uses its own "dialect" of react by having purpose specific components like `<Page>`, etc, and doesn't have inbuilt support for tailwind, In most usecases, you'd just want to build PDFs with plain old react components and tailwind css. This is where BlitzPDF comes in.
